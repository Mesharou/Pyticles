! The following common block contains time variables and indices
! for 2D (k-indices) and 3D (n-indices) computational engines. Since
! they are changed together, they are placed into the same cache line
! despite their mixed type, so that only one cachene is being
! invalidated and has to be propagated accross the cluster.
! Additionally, variables proc and CPU_time are to hold process ID
! numbers of individual threads and to measure CPU time consumed by
! each of them during the whole model run (these are for purely
! diagnostic/performance measurements and do not affect the model
! results.)
!
! Note that real values are placed first into the common block before
! integers. This is done to prevent misallignment of the 8-byte
! objects in the case when an uneven number of 4-byte integers is
! placed before a 8-byte real (in the case when default real size is
! set to 8 Bytes). Although misallignment is not formally a violation
! of fortran standard, it may cause performance degradation and/or
! make compiler issue a warning message (Sun, DEC Alpha) or even
! crash (Alpha).
