Script with demo for use of visual_tools module

- 2_depths : partciles initialized at 2 different depths
             Marker shape differs to indentify particles regarding depth

animation.py : aborted, trying to perform online videos
               Seems more efficient to create a video from a serie of picture
               using ffmpeg or avconv
anim_from_pic : generate a series of plot 
                movie made using ffmpeg

                - anim_2_depths.py 
                case test with 2 different depths
