Script with demo for use of visual_tools module

- 2_depths : partciles initialized at 2 different depths
             Marker shape differs to indentify particles regarding depth

- animation.py : aborted, trying to perform online videos
                 Seems more efficient to create a video from a serie of picture
                 using ffmpeg or avconv

- anim_from_pic : generate a series of plot 
                  movie made using ffmpeg

                - anim_2_depths.py 
                  case test with 2 different depths


                - anim_barycentric.py
                  example were particles at t(i+1) are released at the
                  barycenter of previous of particles released at t(i)
                  after 1 * dt of advection
                  
                  topography is displayed as a background map
                  particles age in color

                - isopycnal_seeding.py
                  Example with particles released at isopycnal surface
